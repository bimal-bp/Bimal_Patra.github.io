### Business Challenge:
- This project aimed to improve the effectiveness of direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) for a Portuguese banking institution. The goal was to predict which clients are most likely to subscribe to a term deposit.

### Approach:

**Data Preprocessing:**
- Cleaned the data by removing missing values and inconsistencies.
- Potentially transformed or combined some features for better analysis.
**Feature Engineering:**
- Created new features from existing ones (e.g., total contact duration) that might be more predictive.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Analyzed the data to understand the characteristics of clients who subscribed compared to those who didn't.
- Identified potential trends and relationships between features that could influence the likelihood of subscribing.
**Model Selection and Training:**
- Trained and evaluated different machine learning classification models on the data, including:
Logistic Regression,Random Forest,XGBoost (Gradient Boosting)
- Compared the performance of each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC score.
**Model Tuning (Optional):**
- Potentially fine-tuned the hyperparameters of the best performing model (XGBoost) to further improve its accuracy.
**Conclusion**
-  Most term deposit subscribers are aged 30-36, with higher education and managerial jobs. Married clients are both the most and least likely to subscribe 
- The XGBoost model achieved outstanding accuracy (0.93) in predicting client subscription behavior.

## About Me

Hi! This is Bimal.I have completed one year of Full Stack Data Science and AI. My aiming is for simplicity in Data Science. Real Creativity won't make things more complex. Instead, I will simplify them, Interested in a Data Science Career and so developing myself accordingly. Data Scientist and lecturer with working experience in Machine Learning, Deep Learning , GenAI and Hands-on experience on classification, regression, clustering, computer vision, natural language processing and transfer learning models to solve challenging business problems. I've a huge interest in AI . I have worked on  a lot of projects and got a lot of achievements.

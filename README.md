## Projects

## 1.Bank-Marketing-Effectiveness-Prediction-ML-Classification
[GithubLink](https://github.com/bimal-bp/Bank-Marketing-Effectiveness-Prediction-ML-Classification)

### Business Challenge:
- This project aimed to improve the effectiveness of direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) for a Portuguese banking institution. The goal was to predict which clients are most likely to subscribe to a term deposit.

### Approach:

**Data Preprocessing:**
- Cleaned the data by removing missing values and inconsistencies.
- Potentially transformed or combined some features for better analysis.

**Feature Engineering:**
- Created new features from existing ones (e.g., total contact duration) that might be more predictive.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Analyzed the data to understand the characteristics of clients who subscribed compared to those who didn't.
- Identified potential trends and relationships between features that could influence the likelihood of subscribing.

**Model Selection and Training:**
- Trained and evaluated different machine learning classification models on the data, including:
Logistic Regression,Random Forest,XGBoost (Gradient Boosting)
- Compared the performance of each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC score.

**Model Tuning (Optional):**
- Potentially fine-tuned the hyperparameters of the best performing model (XGBoost) to further improve its accuracy.

**Conclusion**
-  Most term deposit subscribers are aged 30-36, with higher education and managerial jobs. Married clients are both the most and least likely to subscribe 
- The XGBoost model achieved outstanding accuracy (0.93) in predicting client subscription behavior.

## 2.MLOPS_sensor_fault_detection_END_2_end
[GithubLink](https://github.com/bimal-bp/MLOPS_sensor_fault_detection_END_2_end)

### Problem Statement:
- This project tackled the challenge of predicting failures in a truck's Air Pressure System (APS) using machine learning. The APS is crucial for various functions like braking and gear changes.

### Approach:

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Analyzed the data to understand its characteristics and identify missing values.
Cleaned the data by removing columns with significant missing values (over 70%).

**Missing Value Imputation:**
- Compared five different techniques for imputing missing values in the remaining columns.
Selected the method that resulted in the best model performance.

**Data Balancing:**
- Employed techniques to balance the positive and negative class distributions.
This ensured the model wouldn't be biased towards the majority class.

**Model Selection and Training:**
- Evaluated and compared five different machine learning models on the balanced dataset.
- Selected the model with the best performance as Random Forest with a high accuracy and low cost  in predicting APS failures.

**Modular Coding and Deployment:**
- Implemented modular code for data processing, cleaning, pre-processing, model training, and evaluation.
- Stored the data in MongoDB Atlas for persistence and scalability.
- Developed a workflow for reading data from MongoDB, performing pre-processing and model training, and evaluating model performance.

**Dockerization and CI/CD:**
- Created a Dockerfile to containerize the application, ensuring consistent execution across environments.
- Implemented a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment process.

## 4.QLora_finetune_chat_model
[GithubLink](https://github.com/bimal-bp/QLora_finetune_chat_model)

### Approach:

- This one is a super finetune model for LLM from peft which helps finetune our custom data with a less cost and low compitution as it working in quatization which quantize a large model to small model by converting bytes and it also uses lora config finetune which is a super one because lora only fine some parameters not all which is cost effective and low cost .

## 5.DPO_Finetune_project
[GithubLink](https://github.com/bimal-bp/DPO_Finetune_project)

### Approach:
- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) measures a company's average time to pay suppliers. Lower DPO suggests efficient cash flow and strong supplier relationships, while higher DPO can strain those relationships and harm creditworthiness.

- Similar to fine-tuning LLMs with human feedback, DPO optimization involves balancing efficiency with supplier relationships. Human feedback in LLMs allows direct guidance on factual accuracy, coherence, and style, potentially surpassing reinforcement learning's complexity.

## 6.AWS_sagemaker_ml_project
[GithubLink](https://github.com/bimal-bp/AWS_sagemaker_ml_project)

### Approach:
- Aws Sagemaker is like Machine Learning in cloud which is a best platform for doing code as we have AWS instance power that models  are trained quickly and there are so many tools provided by aws as s3 for stroing artifacts and data and  experiment tracking and Endpoint for deployment. AWS endpoint is seamless endpoint which can scaleble .
